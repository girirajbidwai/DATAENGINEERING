# INTRODUCTION

#### The goal is to do real-time sentiment analysis on bitcoin and store the result in MongoDB.



## Python packages:

#### TextBlob to do simple sentiment analysis on tweets

#### Tweepy is a popular package in Python for interacting with the Twitter API.

## Data Processing Engine:

#### Spark: we will spark to process the Streaming

## Data Streaming Pipeline:

#### Kafka is a distributed event store and stream-processing platform

## Storage

#### MongoDB: Here will we use MongoDB as the output sink.




# STEPS TO GET STARTED WITH PROJECT

## STARTING WITH KAFKA

1.Apache Kafka can be started using ZooKeeper.
 Run the following commands in order to start all services in the correct order:
 ### $ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
 
 
2.Open another terminal session and run:
  ### $ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
 
3.Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that lets you read, write, store, and process events (also called records or messages in the documentation) across     many machines.Example events are payment transactions, geolocation updates from mobile phones, shipping orders, sensor measurements from IoT devices or medical         equipment, and much more. These events are organized and stored in topics. Very simplified, a topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the     files in that folder.
Open another terminal session and run:
  ### bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic bitcoin --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
  
4.A Kafka client communicates with the Kafka brokers via the network for writing (or reading) events. Once received, the brokers will store the events in a durable and   fault-tolerant manner for as long as you needâ€”even forever.

  Run the console producer client to write a few tweets into your topic:
   ### $ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic bitcoin --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    
    
 5.Open another terminal session and run the console consumer client to read the tweets generated by API:
   ### $ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic bitcoin --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
